## Description

**HTTP Archive Tool** is built with TypeScript [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework

The **HTTP Archive Tool** stands up a server with endpoints to parse HTTP Archive files in various ways. It's initial purpose was to detect data privacy violations in a user session. Part of that system has been broken out into a more general purpose parser, which will expose *Shared Strings* in a user's session. **It helps identify dataflow between different host domains.**

It looks to match strings such as "cookies", "headers", and  "query parameters".

You can specify various reports to run on the HAR file.

- Shared String
- Shared String Entity List
- Shared String Differential


Currently Reports will be read and stored in S3. You will have to fill out the `.env` file with the proper credentials.
There will be future support for using local filesystem.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```


## Parser
There are many properties you can customize for the parser. The config is located in the `parser/har/parser.config.js` file.

Improper modification of these values can lead to unneccessary parsing conditions which leads to long parsing times.

`FIRST_CHAR_MIN_LEN` and `FIRST_CHAR_MAX_LEN` values are most sensitive. The smaller the `FIRST_CHAR_MIN_LEN` the more strings the parser will consider in the file. You should probably always have this value greater than 6 or 7. Most unique identifiers are greater than 7 so go ahead and set it higher if that is what you are looking for.  


### How it works

`POST to {SERVER_HOST}/collection-event/parse`
   - There are two supported ways to pass your file to the parser
      1. Send the entire raw HAR contents in the request body
      2. Send the name of the HAR file stored in S3


#### Below are the supported config values
```js
{
    LEVELS: [
        'request',
        'response'
    ],
    ENTRY_TYPES: [
        'headers',
        'cookies',
        'queryString'
    ],
    FIRST_CHAR_MIN_LEN: 7,
    FIRST_CHAR_MAX_LEN: 200,
    REPORT_KEY_NAME_MAX_LENGTH: 60,
    REPORT_URL_MAX_LENGTH: 120,
    INCLUDE_INITIATOR: true,
    INCLUDE_SERVER_IP: false,
    MATCH_COUNT_MIN: 2,
    IGNORE_LIST: [],
    INCLUDE_LIST: [],
    REPORT_PARAMS: [],
    IGNORE_SAME_REQUESTS: true,
    FILTER_SAME_HOST_URL: true,
    FILTER_TIMESTAMPS: true,
    FILTER_URL_VALUES: false,
}
```

### Example Requests for Various Parsing
**Header Request Format**
```js
Headers
Content-Type	application/json
mx-token	Ol692%73kBBfR62itn34nkl(sl20Mf8&&fnC7k3-Pwf42*
```

#### Shared Strings Parse
```js
Request Body
{
	"report_type": "sharedStrings",
	"format": "json", // or csv
	"files": ["<S3 HAR FILE NAME>"]
}
```

#### Entity List Parse
```js
Request Body
{
	"report_type": "entityList",
	"format": "json", // or csv
	"files": ["<S3 HAR FILE NAME>"]
}
```

#### HAR Differential 
```js
Request Body
{
	"report_type": "differential",
	"format": "json", // or csv
	"files": ["<S3 HAR FILE NAME>", "<S3 HAR FILE TO DIFF AGAINST>"]
}
```



## Development
### Creating a new module

Before starting development it is important to understand the NEST framework. There are a couple basic concepts that will help to understand the purpose of each file. **The basic stucture is that each Module has a Component, Service/Repository, Data Transfer Model,  & Interface**. Some of these constucts are just fancy words for very simple purpose.



**You can run the `CreateFullModule.sh` script to have the following files autogenerated for you:**

*(Note that there are occasionally syntax issues when creating a module with a module name that is more than 1 word long)*

- controller
- module 
- dto 
- repository
- spec test file

*Take a look at the `CreateFullModule.sh` code to understand what is happening.*


**After you run the script there are still a few things that need to be manually added.**
- You will need to manually enter in the values into the dto file. Look at the `src/interfaces/entities/<your module>` for all the fields that you will need to add in. Use existing files for reference.

*The alternative is to use the `nest cli` and do it all manually.*
